[$forging-plans](/Users/aaaaa/.claude/skills/forging-plans/SKILL.md) So when I'm using Claude, Code or Codex CLI. I can press control G to open the prompt in an external editor. Right now, I'm using Z because it's written in Rust and it's pretty quick. And I can write the prompt, and then I get the prompt, and then I can save the fire and close the editor, and they get... set back to the original aged CLI's prompt box. I want to take this a step further and have a dedicated editor app. Just for this use case, where it's an app that's macOS native, 1st of all, but it has to be very performant. I'm talking about like sub 50 millisecond code start time. And for this, I'm not sure which language is supposed to use. Maybe it's supposed to be built in pure rust, maybe Swift, maybe C +plus, I don't know. But the thing is, this app is essentially just the prompt editing text editor. So it has to be super lightweight. And I think the format can just be marked down. So it doesn't have to be full, what you see is what you get. I think for now. It just has to be a mockdown editor. that supports backdown syntax, and the syntax can show, but I think the markdown formatings should do display. So like the bold, the headers, the bullet points and stuff like that. And there should also be syntax highlighting. So it's easier to see and edit. Maybe that's something like this already out there, that we can fork, use the study skill to do some research on this. But essentially it just has to be super minimal UI. You know, this editor doesn't even need to open, doesn't even need like a menu for opening files or anything. You know, it doesn't even need a settings page. I think configuration can be done through just convict, JSON or whatever. And it just has to be super minimal UI, super focussed on prompt editing. So that is the 1st part of the project. The 2nd part is the real kicker. And basically, I want this to be The interface where I could do prompt engineering. So usually when I do prompt engineering, I would use a skill like forging plans or something like that within the agent CLI session. And then both through a lot of context, right? And then I'll probably clear contacts to start another session. Or maybe if I'm trying to create a prompt in the middle of a session, I would either just go onto a web chat app. And prop engineer with a chatbot, or I would do like, slash fork to fork the conversation in the CLI, and then do prompt engineering and then go back to the previous session and then paste the prom in there. But that just introduce a lot of friction. So what I'm trying to do is Let's say I'm in the middle of a session. And I've already been developing and the context window is already getting filled up, but I really need to put it a really good prompt. For, I don't know, for a new feature or something like that. So what I want to be able to do is, I just want to type a simple prompt into the prompt box. So say one or 2 sentences. And then I press control G, which would usually bring the external editor, and that would allow you to edit your prompt in the external text editor. But in this case, as soon as I press control G, the full prompt text gets sent out, To an AI agent. So right now I'm thinking, A Codex, Agent running, like a Codex server maybe, because I do want to reduce latency as low as possible. So I probably want the agent to be running warm. And Codex 5.3 Spark is actually super quick. It's smart enough to do prompt engineering, basically. So the moment I press control G, the entire prompt gets sent to Spock. And that agent, immediately, already has a system prompt in place. And so we will immediately start working on the prompt and engineering the prompt. And then I don't really know what the interface is going to be here. Maybe it could be like a split view or a sidebar or a diff view. Or it could be like a kind of like a terminal thing in the bottom. I don't know yet. It's unclear what the best UI is supposed to be. But I still want to be able to chat with the agent. To continue working on the prompt and perfecting the prompt. And every time there's a new iteration, that prompt should get updated, get reflected into the prompt TXT file, right? And so that way, after all the iterations and all the front has been perfected, I would just save the file and close the editor. And now the prompt, the perfected prompt is back onto the original agency LI sessions prompt box. I don't need to paste it anything. I just press enter, and the perfected prompt goes through. So that's what I want to build. That's my raw vision.
