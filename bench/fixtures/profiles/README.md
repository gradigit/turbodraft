# Prompt Engineering Benchmark Profiles

Each draft here is extracted from real PromptPad-related user turns in Codex session history.

## Profiles

- `run_on_promptpad_vision.md`
  - Category: `run_on`
  - Source: session `019c5874-4f13-72e2-a887-a15eace6a82c`, ts `1771012325`
  - Why: long dictation-style vision prompt with mixed requirements and ambiguity.

- `simple_high_work_app_not_opening.md`
  - Category: `simple_high_work`
  - Source: session `019c58a3-ce84-7573-a3a8-239f7e95f4a6`, ts `1771035292`
  - Why: very short bug report that triggered substantial debugging and follow-up implementation work.

- `bug_heavy_agent_clipboard_fail.md`
  - Category: `bug_heavy`
  - Source: session `019c58a3-ce84-7573-a3a8-239f7e95f4a6`, ts `1771041272`
  - Why: compact report with multiple concrete failures.

- `question_heavy_workflow_research.md`
  - Category: `question_heavy`
  - Source: session `019c58a3-ce84-7573-a3a8-239f7e95f4a6`, ts `1771092356`
  - Why: broad exploratory request that invites iterative clarification and research planning.

- `simple_server_feasibility.md`
  - Category: `simple_question`
  - Source: session `019c58a3-ce84-7573-a3a8-239f7e95f4a6`, ts `1771050809`
  - Why: short feasibility question likely to expand into architecture and latency tradeoffs.

- `../dictation_flush_mode.md`
  - Category: `run_on_dictation`
  - Source: user-supplied dictation fixture currently used in benchmark runs.

## Notes

These are intentionally raw user drafts. The benchmark evaluates how well the prompt-engineering adapter transforms noisy, terse, or ambiguous input into a structured actionable prompt.
